00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.390 align:start position:0%
cosmic connections or
not. <00:23:27.933><c>Well, </c><00:23:28.426><c>after </c><00:23:28.919><c>all, </c><00:23:29.412><c>I </c><00:23:29.905><c>think </c><00:23:30.398><c>that,</c>

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
not. Well, after all, I think that,
 

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
not. Well, after all, I think that,
well, <00:23:31.893><c>about </c><00:23:32.386><c>25 </c><00:23:32.879><c>even </c><00:23:33.372><c>40 </c><00:23:33.865><c>percent </c><00:23:34.358><c>somewhere.</c>

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
well, about 25 even 40 percent somewhere.
 

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.789 align:start position:0%
well, about 25 even 40 percent somewhere.
So <00:23:34.900><c>I </c><00:23:35.320><c>think </c><00:23:35.740><c>that </c><00:23:36.160><c>most </c><00:23:36.580><c>likely </c><00:23:37.000><c>yes</c>

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
So I think that most likely yes
 

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:42.390 align:start position:0%
So I think that most likely yes
because <00:23:38.545><c>it’s </c><00:23:39.291><c>shorter </c><00:23:40.037><c>there  </c><00:23:40.783><c>exactly </c><00:23:41.529><c>like </c><00:23:42.275><c>what</c>

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
because it’s shorter there  exactly like what
 

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.710 align:start position:0%
because it’s shorter there  exactly like what

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
they draw on the walls They don’t draw, but these
 

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.310 align:start position:0%

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
was completely redone, redone Yes, and so,
 

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
was completely redone, redone Yes, and so,
initially, <00:39:39.788><c>telescopes </c><00:39:40.016><c>stood </c><00:39:40.244><c>in </c><00:39:40.472><c>place </c><00:39:40.700><c>of </c><00:39:40.928><c>the </c><00:39:41.156><c>eyes,</c>

initially, telescopes stood in place of the eyes,
 

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
initially, telescopes stood in place of the eyes,
so <00:39:41.879><c>there </c><00:39:42.159><c>are </c><00:39:42.439><c>So  </c><00:39:42.719><c>I </c><00:39:42.999><c>don’t </c><00:39:43.279><c>believe </c><00:39:43.559><c>it, </c><00:39:43.839><c>of </c><00:39:44.119><c>course,</c>

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
so there are So  I don’t believe it, of course,
 

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.829 align:start position:0%
so there are So  I don’t believe it, of course,
because <00:39:45.040><c>I </c><00:39:45.600><c>want </c><00:39:46.160><c>proof </c><00:39:46.720><c>Yes,</c>
