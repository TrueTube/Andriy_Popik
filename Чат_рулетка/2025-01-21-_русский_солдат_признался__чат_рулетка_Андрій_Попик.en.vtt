Well, what's the point, it's all already dissolved
That's <00:02:06.585><c>why </c><00:02:06.810><c>a </c><00:02:07.035><c>bunch </c><00:02:07.260><c>of </c><00:02:07.485><c>scum </c><00:02:07.710><c>has </c><00:02:07.935><c>settled </c><00:02:08.160><c>on </c><00:02:08.385><c>the </c><00:02:08.610><c>bottom </c><00:02:08.835><c>and</c>

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
That's why a bunch of scum has settled on the bottom and
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 align:start position:0%
That's why a bunch of scum has settled on the bottom and
now <00:02:09.177><c>they </c><00:02:09.354><c>say </c><00:02:09.531><c>that </c><00:02:09.708><c>when </c><00:02:09.885><c>there </c><00:02:10.062><c>will </c><00:02:10.239><c>be</c>

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 align:start position:0%

Ukraine with  a small population with no technical potential at all How can it lose a little you can say about Belgium about the Vatican you can say Ukraine is not a small country it is the largest country in Europe by territory as far as I remember at least the population was according to official data there was around 35 million 35l people is a lot in fact Deni Putin sent you here there me in the Kherson region with such losses if it were possible to capture Kyiv there 1 2T months and everything in short and ended the war well capture Kyiv and Kyiv how many people are in Kyiv so not how many people how many armies do you capture, no, it's not the population that's capturing, no, it's a problem for all current armies, by and large, when will it be if a major war starts, really? Yes, how can you take a city where the population is not 200, not 500,000, and in which, let's say, half a million people live, that's how it is I don't have to take it because the military as a military science there should be three times more attackers, that is, post щ it's clear But if we start distributing weapons to everyone, that is, there will be no people

who want not military who want to defend their home No well I can't understand well hand out weapons Yes but the question is Where to get so many weapons You understand that if planes helicopters armored personnel carriers fly Who will come out there with these sticks like and pistols what will you do there well how weapons are not just sticks pistols are a machine gun are an anti-tank year because it is very difficult is a tank in urban combat or an armored personnel carrier is well, how can I not say that a panacea for everything in the world and then I can’t understand And why then did Russia get into the B at the very beginning of the war Kyiv encirclement of Kyiv moral impact What approaches what times approach mu Kyiv as far as I know well I know That is I think everyone heard it in the area there were 253 SSA soldiers of ours Well and Kiev Kyiv can not be taken With such a number of soldiers That is it is precisely only on maintaining some kind of a liquid perimeter in order to put pressure on the leadership because now there is no pressure on the leadership, time has been lost. Well, because now the Ukrainian army, at least, let's say now it is no longer  in the state it was in a year ago, well, a year ago, and even at the end, then at the end of the twenty-second year, when they withdrew from Kyiv. This is already a different army, that is, this is already an army that can feed drones until the current year, even until last year, maybe even well, somewhere. So until the beginning of last year, Ukraine was way ahead in drones, that is, in principle, we didn’t have this in such quantities as now. That is, now if there are some videos of how a lancet flies in, this was the case, but it was just a few flying there, like shahids. Well, Shahid okay this is earlier this is also something like about somewhere there flies if you work in the field let's say something like that quadcopters well in such quantities there were not only then it finally dawned on someone that and thanks to the efforts of ordinary citizens who figured it out What can be done to help in this way to purchase these quads, this is the beginning of a mass purchase of them by the military too and having seen how they do it on 3 printers What is the name of the holder for dropping the projectile and now the military is doing it too
