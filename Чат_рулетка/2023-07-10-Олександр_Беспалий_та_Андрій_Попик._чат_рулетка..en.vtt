our youth, IT people, so and so and so on,
they <00:17:13.151><c>go </c><00:17:13.883><c>and </c><00:17:14.615><c>become </c><00:17:15.347><c>drone </c><00:17:16.079><c>operators,</c>

they go and become drone operators,
 

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:18.530 align:start position:0%
they go and become drone operators,
excellent <00:17:17.459><c>operators,</c>

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
excellent operators,
 

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.929 align:start position:0%
excellent operators,
but <00:17:18.969><c>but, </c><00:17:19.398><c>that </c><00:17:19.827><c>is, </c><00:17:20.256><c>it </c><00:17:20.685><c>is </c><00:17:21.114><c>not </c><00:17:21.543><c>the </c><00:17:21.972><c>analogue </c><00:17:22.401><c>down, </c><00:17:22.830><c>but </c><00:17:23.259><c>it </c><00:17:23.688><c>is</c>

but but, that is, it is not the analogue down, but it is
 

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:27.370 align:start position:0%
but but, that is, it is not the analogue down, but it is

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:34.270 align:start position:0%
very unpleasant, it really creates

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
obstacles, they swell up very much and
 

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.909 align:start position:0%
obstacles, they swell up very much and
it <00:17:34.813><c>affects </c><00:17:35.346><c>the </c><00:17:35.879><c>GPS,</c>

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
it affects the GPS,
 

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:41.409 align:start position:0%
it affects the GPS,
so <00:17:38.330><c>what </c><00:17:38.741><c>is </c><00:17:39.152><c>the </c><00:17:39.563><c>effectiveness </c><00:17:39.974><c>of </c><00:17:40.385><c>this </c><00:17:40.796><c>half-</c>

00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:41.419 align:start position:0%
so what is the effectiveness of this half-
 

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:44.570 align:start position:0%
so what is the effectiveness of this half-
