00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
phenomenon, so for example, here we also had these
 

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.150 align:start position:0%

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
monuments to Pushkin removed, they
 

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.950 align:start position:0%
