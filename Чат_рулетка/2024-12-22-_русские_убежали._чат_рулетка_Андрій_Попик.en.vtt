they called it already in the Soviet Union, too, to promote excavations, there is no, there is no Slavic, where did it come from before such a state as Rus, and there was no Kievan Rus, there was just Rus, then they came up with the name Kievan Rus, so as to hint that there is some other Rus, no, Rus, it is only one was with the center in Kyiv so before this formation which was called Rus there was on the territory of modern Rus there was the Andean Union of tribes Antes - these are the tribes that later became Slavs so that is they became Polyane Drevlyane there Look, write it down for yourself then you will read Write down the Andean Union of the Antes, here are the Antes, they had a prince Bosh, prince me Zamir, prince Radegast, yes, that is, and they fought with the Avars, they fought when the Avars attacked the Union of the Andean tribes. And the state of the Antes suffered a defeat, fell apart a little, and then gathered together in the form of the state of Rus'. The fact is that Kyiv yes archaeological confirmation Kyiv Yes  since what century for sure there is Yeah and archeology in Novgorod here 78th century there is nothing in Novgorod nothing Well that is if it turns out to take Here is Rick In general it did not exist But after him Oleg Oleg look it turns out Oleg Oleg also MIFI here is Igor Yes if we look Igor and Svyatoslav these are already real personalities about them there is evidence in this in how it is not only in the chronicle that was later yes And in the Chronicles of other states Yes Arab Constantinople And so on yes that is there is Oleg Oh there is Igor there is Svyatoslav neither Oleg nor Rurik there is no yes Oleg and Rick is mentioned only in this in the Tale of Bygone Years as a legend, but it turns out that as I remember from history, it seems that Oleg gave the name to Kievan Rus. That is, in fact, this is also no, this is yes, this is already a Legend written later in this as it is in the Tale bygone years because look there like adj from somewhere in short Oleg Yes and adj to Kyiv Kyiv was already true
