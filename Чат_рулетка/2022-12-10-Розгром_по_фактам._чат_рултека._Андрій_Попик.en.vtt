Russia is such a mess. That's all.  Russian terrorists started a war in the Donbas so no Who started Here I say Russian tourists invaded and captured the city of Slovyansk  maybe there were no hostilities, which means there was no war.

That is, it’s just five drunks like how you four friends came in and said that we now have the Bryansk People’s Republic, whatever, there were hostilities here until April 12 you  they said on the seventh the riots of hostilities began there wasn’t you already recognize yes, that is, how That is, no one in the city suffered, of course Find Let’s Who was shot was it’s the history of the DPR

that if it really was like that, it was already painted on the Internet The only one who still keeps this secret knowledge You have to tell me this the more number  people Why exactly 7 to 12 now if 7 to 12 there were some kind of military operations before whom Where When they shot there they killed they shot at all the wounded Who was the riots started don’t wait let’s not confuse you were talking about military operations now I don’t confuse anything at  you started civil disobedience let's say there were no clashes yes again They captured him the clash was captured or not you are trying not to wear look again  grandfather means if you are not children These are your problems Let's talk about civilian non-penetration yes about Let's talk about military operations you have already lost so no no not lost Well you lost no you couldn't say You'll look at the military operations in the record Yes, let's now Civil wrong how many people  showed civil disobedience And what's the difference, for example, look if a drunk walks down the street like that throws a bottle and says Putin [ __ ] this is civil disobedience yes yes an insult to the president and publicly if for example this wino walks throws a bottle of keys Putin [ __ ] and says I proclaim St. Petersburg the territory of America he will be caught  the police and go where you need to, that is, one person, I can’t decide anything, well, a bar of some sort, you’re swung around, and now you’re yelling, throwing a bottle, shouting Putin [ __ ] up and proclaiming the St. Petersburg tax, firstly, I won’t do this drunk and a drunk person will be caught well  then to throw a bottle  and they said the People's Republic of St. Petersburg to proclaim it declared the Republic and through an independent state you are now running away again we defeated them or a person How many people did disobedience This is how it looks Why you didn’t stop them how much I want to understand why you didn’t stop them according to the law 1  2 3 how many there were how many people why didn’t you stop them Why did you lose the Donbass lived in the Donbass or How many millions of people went out At a rally, for example, with disobedience Yes, I’m not interested 50 people separated 50 people can’t capture such a separated who proclaimed it I have no idea Exactly  the fact that it appeared Yes, it appeared well and for some reason And who was the first leader of this manifested Donetsk People's Republic, the so-called you will know better than me, really, I wonder if you know, I don’t know Muscovite, a citizen of the Russian Federation, beard your politician, it turned out well that some people  then incomprehensible people in Donetsk proclaimed  some incomprehensible Republic and some man from Moscow became their head, they didn’t understand at all, they chose what the problem was and who chose when Well ask them who I’ll ask them Give me a list of those whom I chose to ask That’s it  the people of the LPR and asks, I don’t know, they sent some kind of [ __ ] from Moscow and said he now you have a head lady sent and then they took and agreed this is your territory there is a police there is an army and the police have cities Let’s eat or not Why They captured When  you captured Kherson If you don’t It’s your problems and it turns out you recognized this territory as yours Yes, and also sent it away ingloriously How do you explain why you gave up the territory that you consider to be the territory of Russia, that is, some Nazi gave this territory so it turns out and what what  this is very good, it shows the whole world that Russia's military operations in Ukraine have ended or not, they will end when they end then  and let's talk that it was good World War II World War II was from the age of 39 and there was no Great Patriotic War Yes, it was only Stalin that called it Well, because they attacked someone Well, because Stalin's ally Hitler attacked him treacherously Yes, we were not like it was not  ribbentrop who signed this pact they attack and here the Soviet Union got Brest who signed Germany treaties how Brest got into Russian territory in the territory of the Soviet Union Brest in Poland how it got Soviet troops entered the territory seized to Poland on the territory of former Poland as it were Poland with  on one side, what troops climbed outside, then the Soviet troops when hostilities began in Poland on September 1, when the Polish government left in full strength if the government can run away, that is, if the government ran away, you can occupy the territory Yes, as I understand it, if the government ran away, it stopped recognizing the country as its citizens yet  once the government  in full force refuses to administer its territory, for example, the government, that is, to give this territory to its own, the Germans captured Brest, the Germans captured the Brest Fortress Yes, how If the Germans captured Brest So, how did Brest become part of the Soviet Union, they handed it over to us and that the Nazis handed over the city to you Yes, why  how did it happen that the Nazis who fought the whole civilized world with them you shared the whole TV with them didn’t fight see already England fought Already no how to start on September 1 2 World all this the Germans attacked Poland, that’s all Germany didn’t fight No And why you, for example Why  if the government runs away of course But if the government refuses to govern its territory This is who if the rulers kill the state one ruler ceases to exist and here the whole government left if the whole government It turns out to shoot the whole state  there is no new government in the country;  were on Red Square When, in 41, in 41, what date is May 1, 1941, the Nazis at the parade in Moscow directly into YouTube, and that how it happened that on May 1 the First World War has been going on for two years almost World War II World War II and the Germans  Nazis, so these inhuman personalities, they are in the Soviet Union at the May Day demonstration along with the Soviet command on Red Square Why not google with us Let's google all grandfather blew up 100 exactly grandfather was smeared on all topics that can only be so starting Donbass ending a pancake as far as they are  cynical critters so more wow  because the government fled, it means there is no country, it can be captured in a shorter time, no matter what, from the realization of the fact that Poland was captured by the Soviet Union, including together with Nazi Germany, they have been going for 41 years The Soviet Union was an ally, it must be so correct And to name what squeezes more they squeezed together  legitimized the attack on Poland, and when they tell us yes, that is, until June 22, before Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, something is normal. The Soviet Union sniffed with these Germans at the May Day demonstration.  Ukraine
