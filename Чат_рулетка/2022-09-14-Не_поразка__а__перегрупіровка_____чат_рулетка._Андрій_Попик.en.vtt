infantry there  so you kill the arrival of russia not so much kill the infantry but still you don’t have enough look explain to me if you killed so many Ukrainian infantry so how can you not hold the front that you are running away from the infantry of the Ukrainian Kharkov we are escaping from the infantry we are only tarkas to the region and that’s all when you were kicked out, like the Kyiv region of Sumy, we moved away, this is my profitability, I’m glad to hear I have a Kent contractor, I have an hour he arrived on vacation, we went there without a fight and left without why we left, that’s why they gave the order about if not, wait for me logic so I create [ __ ] the army runs away, she just entered the city, walks around without a fight to get for the auto club will not perish then explanatory interesting.
