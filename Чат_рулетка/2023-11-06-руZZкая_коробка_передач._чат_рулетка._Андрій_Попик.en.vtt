? <00:28:29.766><c>Well, </c><00:28:30.332><c>I </c><00:28:30.898><c>think. </c><00:28:31.464><c>Maybe </c><00:28:32.030><c>they </c><00:28:32.596><c>gave</c>

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
? Well, I think. Maybe they gave
 

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.830 align:start position:0%
? Well, I think. Maybe they gave
a <00:28:33.096><c>price </c><00:28:33.352><c>tag </c><00:28:33.608><c>that </c><00:28:33.864><c>was </c><00:28:34.120><c>cheaper,</c>

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
a price tag that was cheaper,
 

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.269 align:start position:0%
a price tag that was cheaper,
let’s <00:28:35.496><c>say. </c><00:28:36.152><c>Well, </c><00:28:36.808><c>look, </c><00:28:37.464><c>if </c><00:28:38.120><c>you</c>

00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
let’s say. Well, look, if you
 

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:40.590 align:start position:0%
let’s say. Well, look, if you
make <00:28:38.703><c>two </c><00:28:39.127><c>gearboxes, </c><00:28:39.551><c>yes, </c><00:28:39.975><c>for </c><00:28:40.399><c>you,</c>

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
make two gearboxes, yes, for you,
 

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.549 align:start position:0%
make two gearboxes, yes, for you,
they <00:28:40.850><c>will </c><00:28:41.100><c>just </c><00:28:41.350><c>be </c><00:28:41.600><c>shorter </c><00:28:41.850><c>than </c><00:28:42.100><c>gold </c><00:28:42.350><c>ones. </c><00:28:42.600><c>Yes.</c>

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
they will just be shorter than gold ones. Yes.
