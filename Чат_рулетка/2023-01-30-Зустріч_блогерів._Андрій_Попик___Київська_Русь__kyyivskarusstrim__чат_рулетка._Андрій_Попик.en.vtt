00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
there are such large types on YouTube, well, monetization can be
 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.790 align:start position:0%
there are such large types on YouTube, well, monetization can be

collected, if it exists, but the
 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.770 align:start position:0%
collected, if it exists, but the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
trick is that when

trick is that when

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
monetization disappeared, these views immediately disappeared, so
 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.409 align:start position:0%
monetization disappeared, these views immediately disappeared, so

they are hiring mekats, and you are telling me about the portrait factory, yes, you don't know what your country is called in your native language, that is, but you know it, it's kind of childish in them, they always want to prove that they have a grudge that they are Rus' and their language is it is right there and ours is wrong, that is, they do not imagine their life without Ukraine because they understand that if they do not smear themselves with our history, with our culture, with our so-called language, then they are nobody, they are incomprehensible, they are so-so. We started there a thousand years ago, that’s all. yes, they are some kind of orcs from the swamps, it is not clear where they came from, and it is not clear who they are, some kind of vinaigrette from different peoples, so after the collapse of the Russian Empire, we need somehow, I don’t know, we need a dispa of philologists, historians, politicians, because the state of Ukraine got involved and this name sounds proud, but we need fasten how the Orthodox Church of Ukraine says Rus-Ukraine, that's how it surprised me back then in the 90s, but now I understand how much it was  dro and competently done Rus-Ukraine In other words, we somehow need to revive this name Rus and anchor this name Rus in some non-state laws, but somehow we need to make it an excuse to raise the issue of discussion in society, but Rus We shouldn't use the word Rus because Rus' is us. It's just that in our country, you know, with this aggression, so now everything that is consonant with Rus, as it is perceived as Russian, as if this one, but I think it should be the same as if from the church, when we win, then everything will be much easier because, let's say, it's already going with the llamas, and with the church, we see with the language in the same Dnipro, if you say that people are already trying to speak Ukrainian, yes, that means this evil is already there yes, he won't take him back. Well, it's changed like that, so everything will be fine. I think so, but if you go back to Chad, you can remember some of your funniest moments in the chat room.
