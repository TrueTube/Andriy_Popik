the victors. I think you're very familiar with this,
and <00:02:53.008><c>well, </c><00:02:53.576><c>given </c><00:02:54.144><c>the </c><00:02:54.712><c>fact </c><00:02:55.280><c>that</c>

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
and well, given the fact that
 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.630 align:start position:0%
and well, given the fact that
now, <00:02:57.377><c>in </c><00:02:57.954><c>general, </c><00:02:58.531><c>Ukraine </c><00:02:59.108><c>is </c><00:02:59.685><c>leaving. </c><00:03:00.262><c>In </c><00:03:00.839><c>defense,</c>

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
now, in general, Ukraine is leaving. In defense,
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.550 align:start position:0%
now, in general, Ukraine is leaving. In defense,
the <00:03:01.946><c>President </c><00:03:02.252><c>of </c><00:03:02.558><c>Ukraine </c><00:03:02.864><c>himself </c><00:03:03.170><c>said </c><00:03:03.476><c>this,</c>

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
the President of Ukraine himself said this,
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.070 align:start position:0%
the President of Ukraine himself said this,
so <00:03:05.013><c>now </c><00:03:05.466><c>the </c><00:03:05.919><c>closest </c><00:03:06.372><c>Counter </c><00:03:06.825><c>there  </c><00:03:07.278><c>there</c>

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.949 align:start position:0%
so now the closest Counter there  there
 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
won’t <00:03:10.249><c>be </c><00:03:10.539><c>any </c><00:03:10.829><c>offensives </c><00:03:11.119><c>or </c><00:03:11.409><c>as </c><00:03:11.699><c>they </c><00:03:11.989><c>call </c><00:03:12.279><c>them </c><00:03:12.569><c>counterattacks, </c><00:03:12.859><c>it’s </c><00:03:13.149><c>100% </c><00:03:13.439><c>so</c>

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
won’t be any offensives or as they call them counterattacks, it’s 100% so
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.710 align:start position:0%
won’t be any offensives or as they call them counterattacks, it’s 100% so
uh <00:03:15.224><c>I </c><00:03:15.688><c>think </c><00:03:16.152><c>that </c><00:03:16.616><c>given </c><00:03:17.080><c>that</c>

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh I think that given that
 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.949 align:start position:0%
uh I think that given that
support <00:03:18.043><c>for </c><00:03:18.366><c>Ukraine </c><00:03:18.689><c>from </c><00:03:19.012><c>all </c><00:03:19.335><c>over </c><00:03:19.658><c>the </c><00:03:19.981><c>West </c><00:03:20.304><c>is </c><00:03:20.627><c>declining, </c><00:03:20.950><c>it’s</c>

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 align:start position:0%
support for Ukraine from all over the West is declining, it’s
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.869 align:start position:0%
support for Ukraine from all over the West is declining, it’s
more <00:03:22.487><c>logical </c><00:03:23.015><c>to </c><00:03:23.543><c>assume </c><00:03:24.071><c>that </c><00:03:24.599><c>now</c>

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
more logical to assume that now
 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.429 align:start position:0%
more logical to assume that now
it <00:03:25.151><c>seems </c><00:03:25.423><c>to </c><00:03:25.695><c>have </c><00:03:25.967><c>a </c><00:03:26.239><c>leading </c><00:03:26.511><c>role </c><00:03:26.783><c>on </c><00:03:27.055><c>the </c><00:03:27.327><c>side </c><00:03:27.599><c>of </c><00:03:27.871><c>Russia,</c>

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
it seems to have a leading role on the side of Russia,
 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.229 align:start position:0%
it seems to have a leading role on the side of Russia,
so <00:03:28.679><c>Russia </c><00:03:28.919><c>will</c>

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start position:0%

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
take it on its own terms You burn Russia one and
 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.390 align:start position:0%
take it on its own terms You burn Russia one and
