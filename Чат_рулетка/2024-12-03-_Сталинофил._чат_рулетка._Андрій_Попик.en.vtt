00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.950 align:start position:0%

we <00:24:17.672><c>divide </c><00:24:17.864><c>the </c><00:24:18.056><c>GDP </c><00:24:18.248><c>by </c><00:24:18.440><c>the </c><00:24:18.632><c>population </c><00:24:18.824><c>and </c><00:24:19.016><c>the </c><00:24:19.208><c>result </c><00:24:19.400><c>is </c><00:24:19.592><c>that</c>

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
we divide the GDP by the population and the result is that

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.710 align:start position:0%
just correcting this, that is,
look, <00:28:36.488><c>here’s </c><00:28:36.776><c>your </c><00:28:37.064><c>opinion.  </c><00:28:37.352><c>somewhere </c><00:28:37.640><c>in</c>

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
look, here’s your opinion.  somewhere in
 

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.389 align:start position:0%
look, here’s your opinion.  somewhere in
this <00:28:38.000><c>direction </c><00:28:38.280><c>and </c><00:28:38.560><c>then </c><00:28:38.840><c>it </c><00:28:39.120><c>is</c>

00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
this direction and then it is
 

00:28:39.399 --> 00:28:41.230 align:start position:0%
this direction and then it is
corrected <00:28:39.692><c>again </c><00:28:39.985><c>and </c><00:28:40.278><c>slightly </c><00:28:40.571><c>in </c><00:28:40.864><c>the </c><00:28:41.157><c>wrong</c>

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
spoke changed his time, you can
 

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.789 align:start position:0%
spoke changed his time, you can
say <00:28:48.449><c>so, </c><00:28:48.658><c>but </c><00:28:48.867><c>he  </c><00:28:49.076><c>Kalushi </c><00:28:49.285><c>in </c><00:28:49.494><c>the </c><00:28:49.703><c>same </c><00:28:49.912><c>range</c>
