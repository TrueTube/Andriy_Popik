comment Hello Hello Where are you from? We are from Rus' And where are you from? You come from Rostov but now I live in California 18 years later in 2 years it will be the twentieth Chernigov before it was now now now this is the Tmutarakan principality Krasnodar region Danya that would be well controlled not controlled there or so or otherwise the Russian prince, let’s say, reigned on these lands And there, just like for example, the Russian governor now has a province there  in Buryatia, for example, it doesn’t say anything, it’s the governor who collected the Tribute and you are a cockroach or who is your nationality. The thing is that there is, as it were, there is a concept you know metaphysics or Meta Meta terms Yes Rus' is already a term of such Meta quality and there is a sense of language You In general, you speak Russian well. Well, I’ve been speaking English for 18 years now, so I’ve forgotten Russian a little bit. I already speak metaphysics in English. It’s clear, and what’s your nationality? What’s my nationality?
