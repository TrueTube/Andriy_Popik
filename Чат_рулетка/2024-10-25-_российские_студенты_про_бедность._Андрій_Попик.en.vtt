Uh-huh. That is, you understand. It’s cool you have a car, and what a Toyota Land Cruiser 200, it’s like the second car, what a Kruzak, the first Gelik, the first Gelik, I took it, as a teacher, I can show off and drive something like that. Yes, we just have one car It happens that you drive one car, you want to travel to travel there out of town, you can take one car there, drive a second one, we can afford to lease it, we also didn’t think about moving somewhere to America, it’s possible. But look realistically. Let’s see. Do you even understand the scale of this money? you could buy for 900,000 Here is my monthly salary as a simple teacher at the University of Sacramento 900,000 rubles with your money 99,000 dollars you can now tell where you would spend a month, it’s time for what you would spend 900,000 rubles on if it were, well, just 900,000 at once or if it were every month, every month If you had 900,000 rubles, what would you do, probably put it aside to begin with? Well, of course, you would spend it on life on jelly on food so that you can make money. So that you can eat with that kind of money that you need to eat for 900,000 Well, a lot of rubles are spent on food, in fact, if it’s beautiful. Well, go to restaurants and so on. You can easily spend it, I think, well, that is, if you received 900,000 rubles now, you would go to restaurants like that. Well, I wouldn’t go, but I was if it were possible, yes, I wouldn’t Well, let’s do this Imagine Yes, imagine So, from today you receive 900,000 rubles a month, today you received the first payment and every day for the rest of your life you will have 900,000 rubles of inflation, there will be no inflation That’s what you’re doing Describe how you’re going to get them spent I would probably take a loan if I was sure that this income would be passive, you would take a loan Yes, I don’t understand what you would take a loan for. Well, I would send it somewhere and buy it for her. Well, probably a house somewhere in the south, Yeah, and then you would I took out a loan for my mother so that she could live in a house in the south and with these 900,000 rubles I paid off this loan and then it’s cool. And in the south, this is where, well, maybe I don’t want to send it to another wound, of course, it’s scary, well, the south is Sochi Novorossiys Well, where Yes, wherever you wanted your mother to live out her old age, like in a house, probably in Sochi this is the most normal city. And in Sochi, where like there you would buy her a private house, an apartment like a private house, of course it’s so good, you took out a loan and bought your mother an apartment like in Sochi, which I would provide even further would provide for her so that she wouldn’t work there anymore, but I don’t know if I have housing for myself. Well, I’d probably take a car too. I understand then it’s possible. Well, something like that, you need a Gelik crossover, too, probably next. Why do you want this? You tell me it’s scary to send your mother to another country Why is it scary? We’re not scared in Sochi. For example, Finland or Croatia, I haven’t been to know what’s happening. So I won’t be able to fly to her so often and so on. Why can’t you? Well, I would study with me you will also have a salary of 900,000 rubles a month, you can take it and fly to her every weekend for coffee, I don’t know, I wouldn’t go. If I were to move with her, I would probably go to the USA. Yes, I would move with her, but I wouldn’t send her And why do you say something like, you say I’ve never been abroad, but you didn’t even say I would Travel Like you, if you received 900,000 rubles Yes, you didn’t even get it in your head That I would Travel, for example, around the world, look there Here I looked 5-10 countries Well, I would travel, of course, not without that. I really want to visit Canada in Switzerland. Why in terms of Why Switzerland Well, I like the landscape landscape of Switzerland, well, I like Switzerland. What geographical objects of Switzerland do you know? I don’t know anything interesting. Well from landscapes what is this What mountain in Switzerland what lake do you like I don’t know anything What city of Switzerland do you know I don’t even know the capital I don’t know what do you know about Switzerland except the word Switzerland that it has a flag in the form of a plus sign so super First fact about Switzerland come on let’s pick some five interesting ones Well, it’s not just interesting that they produce good watches by hand Well let it be that Everything is probably the same as the language of communication in Switzerland, mm English, probably Swiss, they have their own language Well, yes, the expected country in Switzerland is the Swiss language So what else everything What is the biggest landmark of Switzerland Well, I don’t know the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa is correct The Leaning Tower of Pisa is correct for what is the efile in Paris The Leaning Tower of Pisa in the doorman And why is it called the Leaning Tower you know no, you once saw how the word pizza is spelled in non-Russian pizza so with two for that yeah Because the Leaning Tower of Pisa is in the shape of a pi pita, if you look at it from above from a drone Yes, it’s in the shape of a pizza, it’s called Pisa in Swiss The Leaning Tower of Pisa is so round okay Yes, I understand, but here’s a question for you, what else prevented you and your mother from going earlier border somewhere to rest Well, it all comes down to money, but the cooler question is who is to blame that in your country people have so little money Well, we all know the answer who [music] who I won’t say I mean, it’s not like you’re afraid of something else how not to be afraid, we don’t have any democracy, I understand Well, okay, it’s not me, I’m not against it, I just go if it’s scary, it’s better, but suddenly a friend listens to you and says, yes, you don’t trust him, it’s cunning, and at least they don’t send you to war, where to go to war. At least you’re not They’re sending Well, while we’re still studying, we’ll be forced into the army in a year, I don’t know, damn, you’re not afraid that they’ll throw you away. Well, they won’t throw you away, but they can send you somewhere to the border in the Kursk region. And they’ll come there from Ukraine. Yes, there is such a thing. I’d like to serve. Yes, we have a nephew of our neighbor in Rostov, he is also a conscript in the Kursk region on the border, just stand here, in short, they trampled the Ukrainians, captured them, and only recently exchanged them. So, yes, there is such a thing. Be careful, how do you feel about this war in general? By the way, you think how Crimea should go to whom as a result of all these movements who Kyiv Crimea Crimea and I don’t know Well Crimea should stay with who Donetsk Lugansk I don’t know And why do you think that’s how you are, a young man do you think is why this whole war started in the first place? Well, as we were told in colleges and so on, we are the same so that Ukraine does not join NATO. Well, what do you think, not what they told you in the media in college? But yours is your decision. What do you think? Why Ukraine and Russia are at war Why did the war start for the sake of money for the sake of money laundering, purely my opinion Yes, I think so too, to be honest Because you know, money is taken from your mother, taken from you and rushed to war, rushed to the war by this whole minister and so on Yes, but people live poorly they only remember about people when they need to be abandoned [music] Yes, it’s sad, too, I don’t know how it all works And when will all this be sorted out by my dad? that he’s such a Putinist, he’s just being rude, he’s saying that you need to hit a nuclear bullet there, damn it, I’m saying everything, Dad, your pension is 18,000 rubles and you, in short, you worked all your life for the state So Okay, let’s move on, thank you So who was I now dad Bashkort mom Tatar from Rostova, yes, like piska, comment, write on th Instagram I don’t know for what, for what, so that there is marvel at the office and for you, tse about yes or three clicks Ale ti trimae me and I will say in me there A bunch of fouls and in me I will be cool set up ro no kru video write nay instag pok Andriy like this, let me check for you

It’s cool you have a car, and what a Toyota Land Cruiser 200, it’s like the second car, what a Kruzak, the first Gelik, the first Gelik, I took it, as a teacher, I can show off and drive something like that. Yes, we just have one car It happens that you drive one car, you want to travel to travel there out of town, you can take one car there, drive a second one, we can afford to lease it, we also didn’t think about moving somewhere to America, it’s possible. But look realistically. Let’s see. Do you even understand the scale of this money? you could buy for 900,000 Here is my monthly salary as a simple teacher at the University of Sacramento 900,000 rubles with your money 99,000 dollars you can now tell where you would spend a month, it’s time for what you would spend 900,000 rubles on if it were, well, just 900,000 at once or if it were every month, every month If you had 900,000 rubles, what would you do, probably put it aside to begin with? Well, of course, you would spend it on life on jelly on food so that you can make money. So that you can eat with that kind of money that you need to eat for 900,000 Well, a lot of rubles are spent on food, in fact, if it’s beautiful. Well, go to restaurants and so on. You can easily spend it, I think, well, that is, if you received 900,000 rubles now, you would go to restaurants like that. Well, I wouldn’t go, but I was if it were possible, yes, I wouldn’t Well, let’s do this Imagine Yes, imagine So, from today you receive 900,000 rubles a month, today you received the first payment and every day for the rest of your life you will have 900,000 rubles of inflation, there will be no inflation That’s what you’re doing Describe how you’re going to get them spent I would probably take a loan if I was sure that this income would be passive, you would take a loan Yes, I don’t understand what you would take a loan for. Well, I would send it somewhere and buy it for her. Well, probably a house somewhere in the south, Yeah, and then you would I took out a loan for my mother so that she could live in a house in the south and with these 900,000 rubles I paid off this loan and then it’s cool. And in the south, this is where, well, maybe I don’t want to send it to another wound, of course, it’s scary, well, the south is Sochi Novorossiys Well, where Yes, wherever you wanted your mother to live out her old age, like in a house, probably in Sochi this is the most normal city. And in Sochi, where like there you would buy her a private house, an apartment like a private house, of course it’s so good, you took out a loan and bought your mother an apartment like in Sochi, which I would provide even further would provide for her so that she wouldn’t work there anymore, but I don’t know if I have housing for myself. Well, I’d probably take a car too. I understand then it’s possible. Well, something like that, you need a Gelik crossover, too, probably next. Why do you want this? You tell me it’s scary to send your mother to another country Why is it scary? We’re not scared in Sochi. For example, Finland or Croatia, I haven’t been to know what’s happening. So I won’t be able to fly to her so often and so on. Why can’t you? Well, I would study with me you will also have a salary of 900,000 rubles a month, you can take it and fly to her every weekend for coffee, I don’t know, I wouldn’t go. If I were to move with her, I would probably go to the USA. Yes, I would move with her, but I wouldn’t send her And why do you say something like, you say I’ve never been abroad, but you didn’t even say I would Travel Like you, if you received 900,000 rubles Yes, you didn’t even get it in your head That I would Travel, for example, around the world, look there Here I looked 5-10 countries Well, I would travel, of course, not without that. I really want to visit Canada in Switzerland. Why in terms of Why Switzerland Well, I like the landscape landscape of Switzerland, well, I like Switzerland. What geographical objects of Switzerland do you know? I don’t know anything interesting. Well from landscapes what is this What mountain in Switzerland what lake do you like I don’t know anything What city of Switzerland do you know I don’t even know the capital I don’t know what do you know about Switzerland except the word Switzerland that it has a flag in the form of a plus sign so super First fact about Switzerland come on let’s pick some five interesting ones Well, it’s not just interesting that they produce good watches by hand Well let it be that Everything is probably the same as the language of communication in Switzerland, mm English, probably Swiss, they have their own language Well, yes, the expected country in Switzerland is the Swiss language So what else everything What is the biggest landmark of Switzerland Well, I don’t know the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa is correct The Leaning Tower of Pisa is correct for what is the efile in Paris The Leaning Tower of Pisa in the doorman And why is it called the Leaning Tower you know no, you once saw how the word pizza is spelled in non-Russian pizza so with two for that yeah Because the Leaning Tower of Pisa is in the shape of a pi pita, if you look at it from above from a drone Yes, it’s in the shape of a pizza, it’s called Pisa in Swiss The Leaning Tower of Pisa is so round okay Yes, I understand, but here’s a question for you, what else prevented you and your mother from going earlier border somewhere to rest Well, it all comes down to money, but the cooler question is who is to blame that in your country people have so little money Well, we all know the answer who [music] who I won’t say I mean, it’s not like you’re afraid of something else how not to be afraid, we don’t have any democracy, I understand Well, okay, it’s not me, I’m not against it, I just go if it’s scary, it’s better, but suddenly a friend listens to you and says, yes, you don’t trust him, it’s cunning, and at least they don’t send you to war, where to go to war. At least you’re not They’re sending Well, while we’re still studying, we’ll be forced into the army in a year, I don’t know, damn, you’re not afraid that they’ll throw you away. Well, they won’t throw you away, but they can send you somewhere to the border in the Kursk region. And they’ll come there from Ukraine. Yes, there is such a thing. I’d like to serve. Yes, we have a nephew of our neighbor in Rostov, he is also a conscript in the Kursk region on the border, just stand here, in short, they trampled the Ukrainians, captured them, and only recently exchanged them. So, yes, there is such a thing. Be careful, how do you feel about this war in general? By the way, you think how Crimea should go to whom as a result of all these movements who Kyiv Crimea Crimea and I don’t know Well Crimea should stay with who Donetsk Lugansk I don’t know And why do you think that’s how you are, a young man do you think is why this whole war started in the first place? Well, as we were told in colleges and so on, we are the same so that Ukraine does not join NATO. Well, what do you think, not what they told you in the media in college? But yours is your decision. What do you think? Why Ukraine and Russia are at war Why did the war start for the sake of money for the sake of money laundering, purely my opinion Yes, I think so too, to be honest Because you know, money is taken from your mother, taken from you and rushed to war, rushed to the war by this whole minister and so on Yes, but people live poorly they only remember about people when they need to be abandoned [music] Yes, it’s sad, too, I don’t know how it all works And when will all this be sorted out by my dad? that he’s such a Putinist, he’s just being rude, he’s saying that you need to hit a nuclear bullet there, damn it, I’m saying everything, Dad, your pension is 18,000 rubles and you, in short, you worked all your life for the state So Okay, let’s move on, thank you So who was I now dad Bashkort mom Tatar from Rostova, yes, like piska, comment, write on th Instagram I don’t know for what, for what, so that there is marvel at the office and for you, tse about yes or three clicks Ale ti trimae me and I will say in me there A bunch of fouls and in me I will be cool set up ro no kru video write nay instag pok Andriy like this, let me check for you
