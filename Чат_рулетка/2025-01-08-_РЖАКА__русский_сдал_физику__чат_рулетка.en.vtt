00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
turns out to be 50, so it is a triangle, yes, that is,
 

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.389 align:start position:0%
turns out to be 50, so it is a triangle, yes, that is,
su  <00:11:28.780><c>Yes </c><00:11:29.520><c>total </c><00:11:30.260><c>Yes </c><00:11:31.000><c>total</c>

additive <00:11:40.439><c>indicator </c><00:11:40.799><c>to</c>

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
additive indicator to

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
exceed 100° and it is impossible for it to be below a
 

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.069 align:start position:0%
exceed 100° and it is impossible for it to be below a
degree <00:11:46.040><c>Yes </c><00:11:46.600><c>because </c><00:11:47.160><c>then</c>

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
degree Yes because then
 

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:53.310 align:start position:0%
degree Yes because then
stratification <00:11:49.759><c>occurs </c><00:11:50.439><c>between </c><00:11:51.119><c>these </c><00:11:51.799><c>additive </c><00:11:52.479><c>layers</c>

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
stratification occurs between these additive layers
 

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.750 align:start position:0%
stratification occurs between these additive layers
and <00:11:53.840><c>For </c><00:11:54.360><c>example, </c><00:11:54.880><c>they</c>

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
and For example, they
 

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.230 align:start position:0%
and For example, they
begin <00:11:56.093><c>to </c><00:11:56.426><c>have </c><00:11:56.759><c>this</c>

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
begin to have this
 

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.110 align:start position:0%
begin to have this
erosion

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
erosion
 

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.710 align:start position:0%
erosion
so <00:12:00.765><c>the </c><00:12:01.410><c>temperature </c><00:12:02.055><c>difference </c><00:12:02.700><c>is  </c><00:12:03.345><c>T </c><00:12:03.990><c>no </c><00:12:04.635><c>no</c>

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
so the temperature difference is  T no no
 

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.509 align:start position:0%
so the temperature difference is  T no no
difference <00:12:05.039><c>A </c><00:12:05.358><c>yes </c><00:12:05.677><c>and </c><00:12:05.996><c>the </c><00:12:06.315><c>total </c><00:12:06.634><c>additive</c>

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
is additive is total in Russian
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.150 align:start position:0%
is additive is total in Russian
Yes <00:12:15.240><c>if </c><00:12:15.360><c>it </c><00:12:15.480><c>turns </c><00:12:15.600><c>out</c>
