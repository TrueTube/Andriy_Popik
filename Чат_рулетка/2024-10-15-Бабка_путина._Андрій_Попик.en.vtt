Well, they study there, but we don’t have the right to look at the books and notebooks, the books and notebooks remain in the Well, that’s how it was decided. Who could have decided that, I don’t know, well, really, look, we don’t give the books back to us I also came to school and wanted to see what books on history tell us that no history books are given only to children for history lessons. Yes, they write notebooks there and immediately take them and do their homework; they stay at school for 2 hours; they stay at school and do their homework. so that the parents don’t have books and don’t watch. What are you talking to me about now, and then your child will succeed if you yourself don’t know what he’s doing, look Well, I think that nothing worse will happen, so that is, well, in principle, your parents watched you textbooks but the result is obvious Yes, I think that if I don’t even look at my child’s textbook yes And what is the result uh what do you think we have the result is obvious Yes, I think that if I don’t even look at my child’s textbook you she won’t grow up Well, I think he will grow up Okay, let’s see what kind of education you have, people I think I understand yes the question You are secondary specially secondary specially super super let’s take a look at this question for our child, we have done everything for higher education damn Good for you in your child’s education I’m talking about this and what will you see?
