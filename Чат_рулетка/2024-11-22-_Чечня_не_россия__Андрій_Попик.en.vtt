yes, look, I’ll explain why in both ways
 

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.829 align:start position:0%
yes, look, I’ll explain why in both ways

00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
Because, for example, a person in  In Ukraine,
 

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:02.509 align:start position:0%
Because, for example, a person in  In Ukraine,

precisely, <00:12:05.850><c>in </c><00:12:06.380><c>Ukraine </c><00:12:06.910><c>he </c><00:12:07.440><c>often</c>

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
precisely, in Ukraine he often
 

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.030 align:start position:0%
precisely, in Ukraine he often

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
operates with dollars than with rubles; in Russia, he
 

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.990 align:start position:0%
operates with dollars than with rubles; in Russia, he

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.509 align:start position:0%
operates with dollars more often than with hryvnias; therefore, it is
